# imageclass1
I made this image classification image in purpose to pass online training at Dicoding Academy, it's kind of final project of that online class. Some bugs or errors in this Jupyter Notebook will be revised soon, and maybe I will add some function to minimize the errors.
This program is about use of machine learning to classify the rock, scissor, and paper image into a class. In this case, I use the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors to identify an object from the image into a class.
The images divided into 3 classes: paper, rock, and scissor. Goals of this program is to identify the input of image(s) that contain 1 of 3 classes that mentioned before into a correct class.
Some analysis or explanation will be added soon.
